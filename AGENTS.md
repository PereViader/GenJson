- The solution contains 3 projects:
    - GenJson: The main library that contains some utility classes and attributes
    - GenJson.Tests: The tests, can be ran to validate the code
    - GenJson.Generator: The source generator which will generate the code. Generated code will use the main library code.
- The generator must use Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp version to 4.1.0
- The tests contain TestSourceGenerator which can be used to analyze the source generated code
